#ElectroMedia Core (EMC)

## Preface
This is a basic version of the ElectroMedia Core without new functionalities. This is Pre-Alpha and I'm currently heavily reworking the program flow, so it is not stable at all at the moment.

## Capabilities of EMC
An analysis suite in C++ dedicated to decoding signals within music files.

## Contributing
* Fork EMC-Core to a repository of your own
* Download [Boost Version 1.58.0](http://www.boost.org/) or later and unzip to your /Program Files (x86)/ directory
* Download [the dependencies suite for EMC-Core](http://www.neuravion.io/file.axd?file=/EMC/EMC%20Requirements.zip "EMC-Core Dependencies") and unzip to the folder containing your executable

## Changelog
* **v0.1.9.6** -- Changed the way that EMC handles Settings with config.json. Now, EMC has a global singleton "Settings" which is loaded into memory by the "SettingsBuilder" (formerly ConfigurationHandler). Further, major improvements have been added to the structure of EMC in preparation for the addition of the Analyzer package.
* **v0.1.9.5** -- Major improvements to nomenclature. Changed many variable names and header guards to fit Google's C++ Style Guide. Also fixed up header inclusions and removed vestigial FrequencyMaximum class.
* **v0.1.9.4** -- Added enumerated Return values for FFmpeg function, added some QoL improvements to ConfigurationHandler and CoreMath for dealing with file extensions and the like. Started tearing apart the ConvertMP3ToARF stuff. Moved ReadARF to EmcCore.
* **v0.1.9.3** -- Removed FrequencyRangeProfile completely in response to Issue #7 on Github.
* **v0.1.9.2** -- Added validation to AnalyzerFactory in response to Issue #6 "AnalyzerFactory should be fleshed out more (e.g. Validation)"
* **v0.1.9.1** -- Added AnalyzerFactory as part of my efforts to root out FrequencyRangeProfile. FRP may actually be irrelevant at this point, I will investigate for 0.1.9.2
* **v0.1.9.0** -- Start of work to factor out FrequencyRangeProfile class and move all Analysis work to EmcCore. Moved a ton of code out of FrequencyRangeProfile, particularly the boundary encoding, to Analyzer itself. Changed a large percentage of code to use smart pointers and other C++14 paradigms. Once this update cycle is complete, we will be at 0.2.0.0 EMC-Core Alpha Release.
* **v0.1.8.0** -- Added EmcCore class, which is going to be responsible for handling the program's workflow and every single component (mostly Analyzers)
* **v0.1.7.4c** -- Removed an enum from ArduinoReadableFileWriter and fixed some stuff in CorrMath/EntryPoint
* **v0.1.7.4** -- Fixed MANY method names to be consisten with naming conventions. Added CoreMath static class and removed CommonOperations... Lots of cleanup here.
